** xAPIsec: a Proposal for an Industry-led xAPI Information Security Standard

** Rationale and Objective

In accordance with [[https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2015/m-15-13.pdf][OMB Memorandum M-15-13]], which mandates the exclusive use of
HTTPS with HSTS across all Federal government web services, it stands to reason
that as a DoD initative, [[http://www.adlnet.gov/capabilities/tla/experience-api.html][xAPI]] should hold itself, at a minimum, to that standard.

This document intends to establish a set of best practices for secure xAPI usage,
hopefully leading to a standard extending xAPI, provisionally termed xAPIsec.

** Initial suggestions

The following have been identified as items that should be established as best
practices for secure xAPI usage with regards to transport-level security, i.e.
the security of the external interface of an LRS:

  - Strong signing algorithm SHA-256
  - Strong key exchange (Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman)
  - HSTS with long duration - including subdomains - and preload directive

These mitigate or prevent:

  - message interception
  - MITM attacks
  - message/statement alteration between AP and LRS

** Second Tier: What to Consider

  - Infosec standards for Activity Providers considered in isolation from LRS
  - Internals
  - Information architecture
  - Secure network hierarchy for SaaS
  - Data persistence mechanism reliability

** Third Tier: What to Consider

  - Full-stack
  - Best practices for intrusion detection sytems
  - Alarm response times
  - Auditing
  - Response to zero-day vulnerabilities
  - CVE response time standards

** The xAPIsec Effort

It is our desire to establish an industry-driven protocol and standard for
xAPI information security.

We would like input from the broad xAPI community and would ask ADL to
assist in pushing out the call for feedback. We will be discussing this
at the xAPI Bootcamp in July as the effort came out of the work weâ€™ve done
in building and testing scalability and security matters throughout the
build of our learning record store and visualization layer.

This document should be considered a general draft outline.
